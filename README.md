# Remove Percent
 Coding Challange

The idea of this challenge is to treat the '%' character as a backspace. So, if there is a letter before a '%' we need to remove that character and the '%'.

I used Node.js to console.log the results to my terminal but I did create a simple html page to display the results as well in the console.
